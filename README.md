# greeter

Sample code for three microservices that construct a greeting.

You can find working, published Docker images for these three microservices at:

* [nathanpeck/greeter](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathanpeck/greeter/) - Constructs a random greeting phrase from a greeting and a name.
* [nathanpeck/greeting](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathanpeck/greeting/) - Returns a random greeting
* [nathanpeck/name](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathanpeck/name/) - Returns a random name

You can find an infrastructure as code sample that deploys the microservice stack automatically on AWS here:
